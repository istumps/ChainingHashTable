# ChainingHashTable

Create a compression(hash) function that intakes a hash code (as uint_64) and outputs the bucket(index) in which the data will be stored. 
Add some values to a hash table using the hash function you created. You may use chaining, linear probing, or quadratic probing to avoid collisions. 
Demonstrates your hash table with a case without collusion, and a case with collusion. Each case must have at least 11 distinct inputs.
